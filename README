1. Dependencies

SPtP requires Python 3. The following libraries need to be installed:
   pillow (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.6.1)
   shapely (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely/1.5.0)
On most systems these can be installed using pip, e.g.
   pip install pillow
   pip install shapely

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Batch processing

The batch processing script (run_batch.py) processes a text file containing
locations. A location has a name, GPS coordinates and any number of space
usage rules. The script is started by running run_batch.py, e.g.

   python3 run_batch.py

By default "./input/surs.txt" is the path to the locations file, "./input/"
is the path to the folder containing images (and *.truth.kml files), results
files are stored in "./output/" and log files are stored in "./log/".

Please use the command line option "--help" to display detailed information on
available command line options, e.g.

   python3 run_batch.py --help

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Graphical user interface

The application features a web-based GUI which can be used with any modern web
browser. Running run_server.py will start the GUI server with default options,
e.g.:

   python3 run_server.py

By default the server is configured to listen on localhost:8080 using the
batch processing script's default paths for images, *.truth.kml and
results files.

More detailed information on available command line options may be displayed
by using the command line option "--help", e.g.

   python3 run_server.py --help

The server itself is a basic HTTP server. The web interface has three basic
functions:
1) Display a location previously processed by the batch processing script.
2) Manually enter a location to be processed. Uploading an image is optional
   and only possible if the browser supports the FileReader API.
3) Select layers (map tiles, buildings, polygons)

The information box in the upper right corner may be expanded by left-clicking
it.

4. Unit tests

The application's unit tests may be performed by running run_test.py, e.g.

   python3 run_tests.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Learning

The learning process allows the generation of factors which determine the 
weight of each weak classifier. A default factors file is included in this 
distribution (/data/factors.txt). The learning process uses input data at 
"./learning/db/" for the learning process and input data at 
"./learning/test/" for verification.

The learning process can be started by running run_learning.py, e.g.:

   python3 run_learning.py

The parameter of the learning process can be controlled through command line 
arguments. For more information run

   python3 run_learning.py --help
